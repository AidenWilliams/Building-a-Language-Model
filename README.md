# Building-a-Language-Model

# Setup

For this assignment I wrote the python package LanguageModel, code documentation and explanation is
included as docstrings inside the code. I put my particular coding and design choices in an md cell with the heading
[Coding Decisions](#Coding-Decisions). I am using the Maltese [[1]](#References) corpus dataset for this assignment
and python version 3.7.

I have also included an html file generated by jupyter notebooks and I recommend viewing that instead of using the
jupyter server. Alternatively I used the Jetbrains Pycharm IDE which also renders the md components neatly.

Included is a requirements.txt which includes the external libraries used in this assignment. To install the libraries
with pip you can use this command:

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

Omit ```sudo``` if you are using Windows.
